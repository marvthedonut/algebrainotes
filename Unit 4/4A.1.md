## Exponent Rules
### Multiplication Rule
The multiplication rule of exponents state that the following is true.
$a^x*a^y=a^{x+y}$
We can see that $a$ is multiplied by itself $x+y$ times in $a^x*a^y$ in the following expansion.
$\underbrace{a*a\ldots*a}_{x-times}*\underbrace{a*a\ldots*a}_{y-times}$
### Division Rule
Building off the [[#Multiplication Rule]] it can be stated that the following is true.
$\dfrac{a^x}{a^y}=a^{x-y}$
This is true because division can be expressed as multiplying the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor. Knowing that reciprocal can be expressed as the number being reciprocated raised to the power of -1 we can determine that the following is true, and then we can apply the [[#Multiplication Rule]]. 
$\dfrac{a^x}{a^y}=a^x*a^{-y}=a^{x-y}$
Therefore showing that $\dfrac{a^x}{a^y}=a^{x-y}$
