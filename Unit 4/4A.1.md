## Exponent Rules
### Multiplication Rule
The multiplication rule of exponents state that the following is true.
$a^x*a^y=a^{x+y}$
We can see that $a$ is multiplied by itself $x+y$ times in $a^x*a^y$ in the following expansion.
$\underbrace{a*a\ldots*a}_{x-times}*\underbrace{a*a\ldots*a}_{y-times}$
### Division Rule
Building off the [[#Multiplication Rule]] it can be stated that the following is true.
$\dfrac{a^x}{a^y}=a^{x-y}$
This is true because division can be expressed as multiplying the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor. Knowing that reciprocal can be expressed as the number being reciprocated raised to the power of -1 ($\dfrac{1}{a^y}=a^{-y}$) we can determine that the following is true, and then we can apply the [[#Multiplication Rule]]. 
$\dfrac{a^x}{a^y}=a^x*a^{-y}=a^{x-y}$
Therefore showing that $\dfrac{a^x}{a^y}=a^{x-y}$
### Power of a Product Rule
The power of a product rule of exponents state that the following is true.
$(ab)^x=a^xb^x$
Using a similar technique from [[#Multiplication Rule]] we can see that this is true by writing an expansion of $(ab)^x$.
$(ab)^x=\underbrace{ab*ab\ldots*ab}_{x-times}$
Since $ab$ appears $x$ times we can see that $a$ and $b$ appears $x$ times. This means we can rewrite the expansion by using the commutative property of multiplication to the following.
$(ab)^x=\underbrace{a*a\ldots*a}_{x-times}*\underbrace{b*b\ldots*b}_{x-times}$
This shows $a$ is multiplied by itself $x$ times and so is $b$. Since this is the definition of exponentiation we can finally rewrite the expansion as a power.
$(ab)^x=a^x*b^x$
