# Rewrite Radicals
This lesson assumes a basic knowledge of exponentiation and will not go over it.
## Exponent Rules
### Negative Exponents
Negative exponents are reciprocals of their positive counterparts. 
$a^{-x}=\dfrac{1}{a^x}$
### Multiplication Rule
The multiplication rule of exponents state that the following is true.
$a^x*a^y=a^{x+y}$
We can see that $a$ is multiplied by itself $x+y$ times in $a^x*a^y$ in the following expansion.
$\underbrace{a*a\ldots*a}_{x-times}*\underbrace{a*a\ldots*a}_{y-times}$
### Division Rule
Building off the [[#Multiplication Rule]] it can be stated that the following is true.
$\dfrac{a^x}{a^y}=a^{x-y}$
This is true because division can be expressed as multiplying the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor. Knowing that reciprocal can be expressed as the number being reciprocated raised to the power of -1 ($\dfrac{1}{a^y}=a^{-y}$) we can determine that the following is true, and then we can apply the [[#Multiplication Rule]]. 
$\dfrac{a^x}{a^y}=a^x*a^{-y}=a^{x-y}$
Therefore showing that $\dfrac{a^x}{a^y}=a^{x-y}$
### Power of a Product Rule
The power of a product rule of exponents state that the following is true.
$(ab)^x=a^xb^x$
Using a similar technique from [[#Multiplication Rule]] we can see that this is true by writing an expansion of $(ab)^x$.
$(ab)^x=\underbrace{ab*ab\ldots*ab}_{x-times}$
Since $ab$ appears $x$ times we can see that $a$ and $b$ appears $x$ times. This means we can rewrite the expansion by using the commutative property of multiplication to the following.
$(ab)^x=\underbrace{a*a\ldots*a}_{x-times}*\underbrace{b*b\ldots*b}_{x-times}$
This shows $a$ is multiplied by itself $x$ times and so is $b$. Since this is the definition of exponentiation we can finally rewrite the expansion as a power.
$(ab)^x=a^x*b^x$
### Power of a Fraction Rule
Very much like [[#Division Rule]], this is a derivative of [[#Power of a Product Rule]]. This rule states the following.
$\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right)^x=\dfrac{a^x}{b^x}$
Again very much like [[#Division Rule]] we can use almost the same thought process to prove this. We can rewrite using the reciprocal of $b$ to get $(ab^{-1})^x$. After this we can simply apply [[#Power of a Product Rule]] to simplify.
$\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right)^x=(ab^{-1})^x=a^xb^{-x}=\dfrac{a^x}{b^x}$
### Zero Exponent
The zero rule of exponents states the following.
$a^0=1$
This can be proved by using [[#Division Rule]].
$\dfrac{a^x}{a^x}=1=a^0$
Any number divided by itself is one, and the [[#Division Rule]] applies we can see $a^0=1$.
## Manipulating Radicals
### Parts of a Radical
Radicals are made up of certain parts. The expression below shows the general usage of a radical.
$\sqrt[n]{x}$
Here are the parts:
$n$ is the index. 
$x$ is the radicand. 
$\sqrt{\phantom{x}}$ is the radical symbol.
